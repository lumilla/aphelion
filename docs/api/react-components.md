# React Components API

> **Note:** React components have been removed from the main `@lumilla/aphelion` package as of version 1.1.0.
>
> Framework-specific components (React, Preact, Vue, etc.) may be released as separate packages in the future.
>
> For now, please use the vanilla JavaScript API in your React applications. See the [React guide](/guide/react) for integration examples, or the [Vanilla JavaScript API](/api/aphelion) for detailed API documentation.
